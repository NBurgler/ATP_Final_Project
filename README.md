# ATP_Final_Project
This is a NetLogo simulation that simulates people walking through a store. The simulation will eventually test the impact of having a predetermined walking route through the store on a virus' ability to spread. We color-code the intended walking directions as follows:

| Color  | Direction |
| ------ | --------- |
| Green  | Up        |
| Blue   | Right     |
| Red    | Down      |
| Yellow | Left      |

The simulation contains compliant and non-compliant agents, only the compliant agents will look at the colors and follow the intended route.

Additionally, we start the simulation with a certain number of infected agents, the infection has a chance to spread if the agents are within a set radius of each other.

In the current version of the simulation, the store has no exits. This will be implemented in a future version.
